## Test Product Overview:
The purpose of the Online Vehicle Registration and Driver's License Application (Central Processing System) is to simplify the process of registering vehicles and obtaining driver's licenses through a web-based platform. This system enables various known entities, such as dealerships, fleets, trucking unions, and individual drivers to register with service providers and submit their applications electronically. Once the applications are submitted, the system processes them and delivers the registrations or driver's licenses to the entities or individual drivers. The application aims to offer a hassle-free and user-friendly experience while ensuring adherence to relevant regulations, standards, and laws. Additionally, the system performs weekly financial reconciliations between the Central Processing System (CPS) or CPS_Lite and ACH to guarantee the accuracy of transactions
